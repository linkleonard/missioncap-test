# MissionCap Hiring Test

This repository is an example implementation by Leonard Law for MissionCap's hiring test. Specs for the test can be found under `docs/`.

This solution was written in Python3.5. It will most likely not run in prior versions.

Usage:

```
$ python main.py input_file output_file
```

**It will OVERWRITE the destination file without prompting! Please be careful.**
